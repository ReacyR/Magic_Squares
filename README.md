# Magic_Squares
***
A magic square is a mathematical puzzle similar to a sudoko but with a twist. You are given a grid of numbers with some blanks that
must be filled in to solve the puzzle. In order for your solution to be correct, each of the rows, columns, and diagonals must add up
to the same number(which is not given to you, you must solve for this also).
